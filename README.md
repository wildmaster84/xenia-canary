# Netplay Fork

This is a fork of [Xenia-Canary Netplay](https://github.com/ahnewark/sunrise-xenia-canary-netplay) which implements online multiplayer features.
It has been built from the ground up and a handful of games found to work, though many games are yet to be tested. Check out the [Issues](https://github.com/ahnewark/sunrise-xenia-canary-netplay/issues) list for more details.

The REST API powering this fork can be found [here](https://github.com/AdrianCassar/Xenia-WebServices).

Massive thanks to @SarahGreyWolf for testing this fork with me for about a month, couldn't have done it without her.
Also, thank you to @Bo98 for creating the burnout5 xenia fork, I used that as a basis for this, and some of the code is still here I think.

Peace and hair grease

## FAQ:

Is UPnP implemented?
- Yes, **UPnP** is now implemented therefore manual port forwarding is no longer required.

Is **Systemlink** or **XLink Kai** supported?

- No, Systemlink and XLink Kai are not supported.

Can I host Xenia Web Services?

- Yes, [Xenia Web Services](https://github.com/AdrianCassar/Xenia-WebServices).

Is there a Netplay mousehook build?

- Yes, download it from [Netplay Mousehook](https://github.com/marinesciencedude/xenia-canary-mousehook/releases?q=Netplay).

Are games dependant on servers?

- Yes a lot of games are dependant on servers therefore will not work, unless a server is developed for that game. For example many games requires EA servers, without them netplay will not work. 

Can I use multiple instances for the same game?

- No, you cannot use multiple instances due to the first instance using up ports. You will need to use a VM.

Can I use multiple PCs on the same network?

- No, you currently cannot use different PCs on the same network to connect to a session hosted on the same network. However a VPN will get around this issue.

Where can I **download** the Canary Netplay build?

- You can download it from [releases](https://github.com/AdrianCassar/xenia-canary/releases).

## Config Setup

To connect to a **Xenia WebServices** server you can either privately host it yourself or connect to my server.

```toml

```

UPnP is disabled by default, you can enable it in the config.
```toml
upnp = true

## Contributors Wanted!

Have some spare time, know advanced C++, and want to write an emulator?
Contribute! There's a ton of work that needs to be done, a lot of which
is wide open greenfield fun.

**For general rules and guidelines please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).**

Fixes and optimizations are always welcome (please!), but in addition to
that there are some major work areas still untouched:

* Help work through [missing functionality/bugs in games](https://github.com/xenia-project/xenia/labels/compat)
* Reduce the size of Xenia's [huge log files](https://github.com/xenia-project/xenia/issues/1526)

See more projects [good for contributors](https://github.com/xenia-project/xenia/labels/good%20first%20issue). It's a good idea to ask on Discord and check the issues page before beginning work on
something.

## Disclaimer

The goal of this project is to experiment, research, and educate on the topic
of emulation of modern devices and operating systems. **It is not for enabling
illegal activity**. All information is obtained via reverse engineering of
legally purchased devices and games and information made public on the internet
(you'd be surprised what's indexed on Google...).
